# Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project is focused on predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from the Ease My Trip website in CSV format. With over 300 thousand rows and 12 columns, the dataset underwent preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights and prepare it for modeling.

### Project Highlights
* __Data Collection:__ Obtained flight data from Ease My Trip website in CSV format.
* __Preprocessing:__ Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
* __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ Visualized and analyzed the data through various plots and graphs to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset.
* __Modeling:__ Employed five different machine learning models to predict flight prices.
* __Model Evaluation:__ Selected the model with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the highest R-squared (R2) score.
* __Best Performing Model:__ K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model achieved 96.39% accuracy in predicting flight prices.
